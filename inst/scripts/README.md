Scripts for updating the Lahman package
=======================================

This folder contains the scripts used to create the current version of the Lahman package from the
.csv sources at `http://seanlahman.com/files/database/`.

They are left in the state of last use, meaning they refer to local directories on the machine of whomever
ran them last.

These notes should probably be updated for the next time ...

* `readLahman.R` -- read the Lahman data base .csv files & create Rdata files

* `lahman-compare.R` -- attempt to compare two versions of the data base

* `lahmanData.R` - create the LahmanData data set summary
